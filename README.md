# Scientific Calculator
A web-based scientific calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Supports basic operations (+, -, *, /), exponentiation (^), percentage (%), scientific functions (sin, cos, tan, √, x²), 
and error handling for edge cases, with a responsive dark theme design.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic, percentage, and scientific calculations via button inputs.
- Error handling for division by zero, invalid square roots, and undefined tangents.
- Responsive dark theme with distinct styling for digit, operator, scientific, and AC buttons.
- Results rounded to 4 decimal places for precision.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in a browser to use the calculator. Click buttons to perform calculations.
